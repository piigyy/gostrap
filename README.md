# GoStrap

using **GoStrap** probably will going to be the easiest way for you to create new Go project using your existing project template.

This CLI actually only do:
- Clone you Go Project templates to new directory.
- Re init the git.
- Replace the old go module name with the new one.

YES! You can use any project template you wanted!

<i>please tell me if you have easier way than this CLI. I need it too!</i>

## Install
If you using Go version 1.17 or newer, you can use this command
```bash
go install github.com/piigyy/gostrap@latest
```
If you using elder version of Go (<1.17), well tbh I don't know if this CLI support it. Buy a try wouldn't hurt, right?
```bash
go install github.com/piigyy/gostrap@latest
```
